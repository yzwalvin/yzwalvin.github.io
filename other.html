      <p class="lead">
        The goal is to combine techniques to create a more immersive type of group AI 
that does not rely only on just "sight", or range, but adds a layer of depth by 
having "sound detection", and communication between the AIs.

            Enemy pathfinding uses sound-based heatmaps. When the player or a mob produces
            a sound (walking, throwing objects, etc.), it generates heat at the source that
            dissipates outward to nearby grids, decreasing in intensity until it fades. 
            </p>

            <p>
            Continuous movement keeps
            the area warm, layering new heat on top of existing sources.

              The "hotter" areas (red near the source, green at the edges) represent sound strength,
            giving both the AI and player spatial audio awareness. 
            </p>
            <p>
              More heat can be generated if the player starts running, showing the realistic aspect of
              how different actions can produce different levels of sound.

        There will be multiple enemy AI roaming around that will detect the player if their 
heat reaches the AI. When the player is detected, all nearby enemy AI will group up 
to search the last known area where sound was produced.

      <p style="margin-top:30px">
        Games that rely on a similar technology use it for enemy AIs to pathfind to the player. 
Within games there may be a quest where the player has to be sneaky within a 
specified zone, with the idea of using a heat map to indicate the loudness of the 
player's footsteps, so the player will need to plan and strategise how they will get 
through the objective without getting caught. This may help showcase on how to 
visualise where the sound is coming from with the "hotter" being more obvious.

  The system implements a sound-reactive enemy AI using A* pathfinding over a grid-based 
map. The enemies respond dynamically to the auditory cues, which in this case are the 
heatmap and visual detection using the Line-of-Sight (LOS) mechanic. The system is 
composed of the following two components for a cost-efficient pathfinding AI. 
</p>
        </div>
      </div>

<br>

      <h2 class="subtitle">Grid-Based Sound Heatmap</h2>
         <p class="lead">
         The environment is represented as a 2D grid, where each cell carries a "heat" value from 0 
to 255, where 0 represents the "quietest" and 255 represents the "loudest". These values 
simulate the intensity of the sound or noise generated by the player. 
<br> Enemy AI agents would 
reference this heatmap to decide to investigate the source of the "heat" and where the source 
is located. 
      </p>
<br>
      <h2 class="subtitle">A* Pathfinding Controller</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        The pathfinding component determines the shortest cost-efficient path from an enemy's 
current location to the target goal, in this case is set as the player. Using the A* algorithm 
that evaluates nodes by calculating a final cost combining the actual movement cost from 
start to current node and the heuristic cost from the current node to the goal. 
      </p>
       <br>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Enemy Decision Logic</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Enemy agents operate using a reactive behaviour system that prioritises visual and auditory 
cues within the game environment. These cues determine if the enemy would visually chase 
the player using LOS, react to the noise based on the heatmap, respond to a nearby fellow 
enemy's "shout" signal or roam randomly when no stimuli are detected. 
      </p>
<br>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Grid-Based Sound Heatmap </h2>
      <p class="lead">
        In addition to the auditory cues using the heatmap, the enemy agents also have the 
Line-of-Sight (LOS) mechanic. The system uses a field-of-view (FOV) to determine 
whether the player is visible, and a visible line from the enemy to the player would appear to 
showcase the LOS. <br>
If the player is detected visually, the enemy would immediately go towards the 
player, ignoring any sound-based check logic.
